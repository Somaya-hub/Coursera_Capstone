I will relocating to Vancouver, more specifically, and would like to explore the safest neighborhoods there. I am considering starting a side business as well and would love to find the safest area to both raise my family and start my authentic middle eastern food shop business. \n\n### My goal for this project is to find a safe neighborhood in Vancouver, Canada. To do that, I will start by choosing the safest borough by analysing crime data and short listing a neighbourhood.
