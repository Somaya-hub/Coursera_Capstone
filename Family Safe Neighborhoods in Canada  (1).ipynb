I will relocating to Vancouver, more specifically, and would like to explore the safest neighborhoods there. I am considering starting a side business as well and would love to find the safest area to both raise my family and start my authentic middle eastern food shop business. \n## My goal for this project is to find a safe neighborhood in Vancouver, Canada. To do that, I will start by choosing the safest borough by analysing crime data and short listing a neighbourhood. I will then analyse data and focus on the safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood to explore the options for my potential business.

These are:\n1. Finding the safest borough based on crime statistics\n2. Choosing the right neighbourhood within the borough\n3. Finding the most common businesses in the area\n\nTo do that, I will utilize the geographical coordinates of Vancouver to plot neighbourhoods in a borough that is safe and in the city's vicinity, and finally cluster our neighborhoods and present our findings.\n\nData Sources:\n\n1. Real world data set from Kaggle containing the Vancouver Crimes from 2003 to 2019: A dataset consisting of the crime statistics of each Neighbourhoof in Vancouver along with type of crime, recorded year, month and hour.\n\n2. Gathering additional information of the list of officially categorized boroughs in Vancouver from Wikipedia.: Borough information will be used to map the existing data where each neighbourhood can be assigned with the right borough.\n\n3. Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, along with their boroughs, crime data and the respective Neighbourhood's co-ordinates.: This data will be fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest borough and explore the neighbourhood by plotting it on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis.\n\n4. Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, boroughs, and the most common venues and the respective Neighbourhood along with co-ordinates.: This data will be fetched using Four Square API to explore the neighbourhood venues and to apply machine learning algorithm to cluster the neighbourhoods and present the findings by plotting it on maps using Folium."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
